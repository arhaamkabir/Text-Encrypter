# Text-Encrypter
A program that will encrypt texts in English language. It uses the Caesar cipher and other elements to encrypt the desired texts. 
The program starts with the dictionary 'Mapping' which contains all the character which corresponds to other characters. Then the cipher function, which thakes the 'original' argument, encrypts the code by changing the values to the ones in the dictionary and it can be used backwards to decrypt an encrpyted message. Next, the check function, which also has the 'original' argumaent, checks for unsupported characters in the inputed text. Afterwards, the run_program function runs the previous two programs and returns the output. Finally, there is an infinite loop at the end, asking the user if they want to rerun the program gain.
